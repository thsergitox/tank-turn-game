## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the game client and the backend server.

### Game Client (`src/`)
- `main.py`: Entry point for the game client
- `app/`: Main application directory
  - `core/`: Core game logic (game manager, object controller)
  - `models/`: Game object models (tanks, bullets)
  - `views/`: Game views (menu, stats, game)
  - `util/`: Utility functions
  - `config.py`: Client configuration

### Backend Server (`backend/`)
- `src/`: Source code for the backend
  - `app/`: Main application directory
    - `database/`: Database connection and queries
    - `models/`: Data models
    - `routes/`: API routes
    - `services/`: Business logic
    - `main.py`: Entry point for the backend server
  - `tests/`: Backend tests
  - `features/`: Behavior-driven development features

### Grafana (`grafana/` and `grafana_data`)
- `grafana`:
  - `dashboards`: Containts .json dashsboards to import.
  - `grafan.ini`: Configuration SMTP file for alerts.
- `grafana_data`: To initialize volumen.

### Prometheus (`prometheus_data`):
- `prometheus_data`:
  - `prometheus.yml`: Prometheus configuration file,

### Docs (`docs/`):
- `docs`: Contains Markdowns with the contributions of each member.


## Requirements

For this project we are using [Python >= 3.12](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Docker Engine >= 27](https://docs.docker.com), it is not test in other versions.

## Setup and Installation

Due we are using `pygame` for our projectm we only used Docker for the backend, so you will need to setup and python enviroment a build the containers wiht `docker compose`

Using `run.sh` file

1. Activate permissioons for `run.sh` file.
  
```
chmod +x ./run.sh
```

2. Run the script file.

```
sudo ./run.sh
```

Enjoy our game.


Manually setup.

1. First, create a `grafana_data` directory:

```
mkdir grafa_data
```

2. Now let's build our containers.
```
docker compose up --build -d
```

This commando builds our container in `compose.yml`.
```
Our container:
  prometheus        
  mongodb           
  mongodb_exporter  
  grafana            
  backend         
```

If you want to see any container's log, you cand execute:
```
docker compose logs <container_name>
```

Once it is completed our backend at `localhost:8000`, let's to initialize our game.

1. Let's create a python enviroment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
```

2. Activate it, if you are in linux run this:
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


4. Finished, let's enjoy our game:
```
python3 src/app/main.py
```




## Development

- The project uses pre-commit hooks for code formatting (Black)
- Backend tests can be run using pytest 
- Behavior-driven development tests are implemented using Behave

## CI/CD

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) for continuous integration, which runs tests and checks code formatting.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts: the game client and the backend server.

### Game Client (`src/`)
- `main.py`: Entry point for the game client
- `app/`: Main application directory
  - `core/`: Core game logic (game manager, object controller)
  - `models/`: Game object models (tanks, bullets)
  - `views/`: Game views (menu, stats, game)
  - `util/`: Utility functions
  - `config.py`: Client configuration

### Backend Server (`backend/`)
- `src/`: Source code for the backend
  - `app/`: Main application directory
    - `database/`: Database connection and queries
    - `models/`: Data models
    - `routes/`: API routes
    - `services/`: Business logic
    - `main.py`: Entry point for the backend server
  - `tests/`: Backend tests
  - `features/`: Behavior-driven development features

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set up the MongoDB database and backend server with docker compose
    ```
    docker compose up --build -d
    ```
4. Run the game client:
   ```
   cd src
   python main.py
   ```

## Development

- The project uses pre-commit hooks for code formatting (Black)
- Backend tests can be run using pytest 
- Behavior-driven development tests are implemented using Behave

## CI/CD

The project includes a GitHub Actions workflow (`ci.yml`) for continuous integration, which runs tests and checks code formatting.
